            <b>Graphic design </b>is a  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profession"> profession <sup>[2] </sup> </a>  <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_discipline" >academic discipline <sup>[3][4][5]</sup> </a> and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_arts" >applied art </a> whose activity consists in projecting <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_communication" >visual communications </a> intended to transmit specific messages to social groups, with specific objectives.<sup>[6]</sup> Graphic design is an interdisciplinary branch of <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design" >design </a> and of the <a href= "#" >fine arts</a>. Its practice involves <a href = "#" >creativity, innovation</a> and <a href = "#">lateral thinking</a> using manual or <a href= "#" >digital tools</a>, where it is usual to use text and graphics to communicate visually.

        <p>
            The role of the <a href= "#" >graphic designer</a> in the communication process is that of encoder or interpreter of the message. They work on the interpretation, ordering, and presentation of visual messages. Usually, graphic design uses the <a href= "#" >aesthetics of typography</a> and the compositional arrangement of the text, ornamentation, and imagery to convey ideas, feelings, and attitudes beyond what language alone expresses. The design work can be based on a customer's demand, a demand that ends up being established linguistically, either orally or in writing, that is, that graphic design transforms a linguistic message into a graphic manifestation.<a href = "#" > <sup> [7]</sup></a>
        </p>

        <p>
            Graphic design has, as a field of application, different areas of knowledge focused on any visual communication system. For example, it can be applied in advertising strategies, or it can also be applied in the <a href = "#"  >aviation </a> world[8] or <a href = "#" >space explorations <sup> [9][10]</sup></a> In this sense, in some countries graphic design is related as only associated with the production of sketches and drawings, this is incorrect, since visual communication is a small part of a huge range of types and classes where it can be applied.

        <h2 id="terminology">Terminology</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            <a href = "#" > William Addison Dwiggins</a> is often credited with first using the term "graphic design" in a 1922 article,[14] although it appears in a 4 July 1908 issue (volume 9, number 27) of Organized Labor, a publication of the Labor Unions of San Francisco, in an article about technical education for printers:<sup> [15]</sup>
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            An Enterprising Trades Union <br>
            … The admittedly high standard of intelligence which prevails among printers is an assurance that with the elemental principles of design at their finger ends many of them will grow in knowledge and develop into specialists in graphic design and decorating …
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            A decade later, the 1917–1918 course catalog of the <a href = "#" >California School of Arts & Crafts</a> advertised a course titled Graphic Design and Lettering, which replaced one called Advanced Design and Lettering. Both classes were taught by <a href = "#" > Frederick Meyer.<sup>[16]</sup></a>

        </a></i></h4>
        <p>
            In both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion of <a href = "#"> visual communication</a> in the 20th and 21st centuries, the distinction between advertising, art, graphic design and fine art has disappeared. They share many elements, theories, principles, practices, <a href = "#" >languages</a> and sometimes the same benefactor or client. In advertising, the ultimate objective is the sale of goods and services. In graphic design, "the essence is to give order to information, form to ideas, expression, and feeling to artifacts that document the human experience."<sup> [17]</sup>
        </p>
        
        <h3>The advent of printing</h3>
        <h4><i>Main article: History of <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_graphic_design" >History of graphic design
        </a></i></h4>
            In China, during the <a href = "#" >Tang Dynasty</a>(618–907) wood blocks were cut to print on textiles and later to reproduce Buddhist texts. A Buddhist scripture printed in 868 is the earliest known printed book. Beginning in the 11th century in China, longer scrolls and books were produced using <a href = "#" >movable type</a> printing, making books widely available during the <a href="#">Song dynasty</a> (960–1279).<sup> [18]</sup>
        </p>

        <p>
            In the mid-15th century in Mainz, Germany, <a href="#" >Johannes Gutenberg</a> developed a way to reproduce printed pages at a faster pace using <a href = "#" >movable type</a> made with a new metal alloy<sup>[19]</sup> that created a revolution in the dissemination of information.<sup> [20]</sup>
        </p>

        <h3>Nineteenth century</h3>
        
        <p>
            In 1849, <a href="#" >Henry Cole</a> became one of the major forces in design education in Great Britain, informing the government of the importance of design in his Journal of Design and Manufactures. He organized the <a href="#" >Great Exhibition</a> as a celebration of modern industrial technology and Victorian design.
        </p>

        <p>
            From 1891 to 1896, <a href="#">William Morris' Kelmscott Press</a> was a leader in graphic design associated with the <a href="#">Arts and Crafts movement</a>, creating hand-made books in medieval and Renaissance era style,[21] in addition to wallpaper and textile designs.[22] Morris' work, along with the rest of the Private Press movement, directly influenced Art Nouveau.[23]
        </p>

        <p>
            <a href = "#">Will H. Bradley</a> became one of the notable graphic designers in the late nineteenth-century due to creating art pieces in various Art Nouveau styles. Bradley created a number of designs as promotions for a literary magazine titled <i>The Chap-Book.</i><sup>[24]</sup>

    <h3>Twentieth century</h3>
        
    <p>
        In 1917, Frederick H. Meyer, director and instructor at the California School of Arts and Crafts, taught a class entitled "Graphic Design and Lettering".[25] Raffe's Graphic Design, published in 1927, was the first book to use "Graphic Design" in its title.[26] In 1936, author and graphic designer Leon Friend published his book titled "Graphic Design" and it is known to be the first piece of literature to cover the topic extensively.[27]

        The signage in the London Underground is a classic design example[28] of the modern era. Although he lacked artistic training, Frank Pick led the Underground Group design and publicity movement. The first Underground station signs were introduced in 1908 with a design of a solid red disk with a blue bar in the center and the name of the station. The station name was in white sans-serif letters. It was in 1916 when Pick used the expertise of Edward Johnston to design a new typeface for the Underground. Johnston redesigned the Underground sign and logo to include his typeface on the blue bar in the center of a red circle.[29]

        In the 1920s, Soviet constructivism applied 'intellectual production' in different spheres of production. The movement saw individualistic art as useless in revolutionary Russia and thus moved towards creating objects for utilitarian purposes. They designed buildings, theater sets, posters, fabrics, clothing, furniture, logos, menus, etc.[30]

        Jan Tschichold codified the principles of modern typography in his 1928 book, New Typography.[31] He later repudiated the philosophy he espoused in this book as fascistic, but it remained influential.[citation needed] Tschichold, Bauhaus typographers such as Herbert Bayer and László Moholy-Nagy and El Lissitzky greatly influenced graphic design. They pioneered production techniques[citation needed] and stylistic devices used throughout the twentieth century. The following years saw graphic design in the modern style gain widespread acceptance and application.[32]

        From scientific journals to news reporting, the presentation of opinion and facts is often improved with graphics and thoughtful compositions of visual information – known as information design. With the advent of the web, information designers with experience in interactive tools are increasingly used to illustrate the background to news stories. Information design can include data visualization, which involves using programs to interpret and form data into a visually compelling presentation, and can be tied in with information graphics.

    The "process school" is concerned with communication; it highlights the channels and media through which messages are transmitted and by which senders and receivers encode and decode these messages. The semiotic school treats a message as a construction of signs which through interaction with receivers, produces meaning; communication as an agent.
    </p>

    <h3>Typography</h3>
        
    <p>
        Typography includes type design, modifying type glyphs and arranging type. Type glyphs (characters) are created and modified using illustration techniques. Type arrangement is the selection of typefaces, point size, tracking (the space between all characters used), kerning (the space between two specific characters) and leading (line spacing).
    </p>

    <h3>Page layout</h3>
    <p>
        Page layout deals with the arrangement of elements (content) on a page, such as image placement, text layout and style. Page design has always been a consideration in printed material and more recently extended to displays such as web pages. Elements typically consist of type (text), images (pictures), and (with print media) occasionally place-holder graphics such as a dieline for elements that are not printed with ink such as die/laser cutting, foil stamping or blind embossing.
    </p>

    <h3>Grids</h3>
    <p>
        A grid serves as a method of arranging both space and information, allowing the reader to easily comprehend the overall project. Furthermore, a grid functions as a container for information and a means of establishing and maintaining order. Despite grids being utilized for centuries, many graphic designers associate them with Swiss design. The desire for order in the 1940s resulted in a highly systematic approach to visualizing information. However, grids were later regarded as tedious and uninteresting, earning the label of "designersaur." Today, grids are once again considered crucial tools for professionals, whether they are novices or veterans.[36]

    <p>
        In the mid-1980s desktop publishing and graphic art software applications introduced computer image manipulation and creation capabilities that had previously been manually executed. Computers enabled designers to instantly see the effects of layout or typographic changes, and to simulate the effects of traditional media. Traditional tools such as pencils can be useful even when computers are used for finalization; a designer or art director may sketch numerous concepts as part of the creative process.[37] Styluses can be used with tablet computers to capture hand drawings digitally.[38]
    </p>
    <h3>Computers and software</h3>
   <p>
    Designers disagree whether computers enhance the creative process.[39] Some designers argue that computers allow them to explore multiple ideas quickly and in more detail than can be achieved by hand-rendering or paste-up.[40] While other designers find the limitless choices from digital design can lead to paralysis or endless iterations with no clear outcome.
    </p>

    <p>
        Graphic designers are expected to be proficient in software programs for image-making, typography and layout. Nearly all of the popular and "industry standard" software programs used by graphic designers since the early 1990s are products of Adobe Inc. Adobe Photoshop (a raster-based program for photo editing) and Adobe Illustrator (a vector-based program for drawing) are often used in the final stage. CorelDraw, a vector graphics editing software developed and marketed by Corel Corporation, is also used worldwide. Designers often use pre-designed raster images and vector graphics in their work from online design databases. Raster images may be edited in Adobe Photoshop, vector logos and illustrations in Adobe Illustrator and CorelDraw, and the final product assembled in one of the major page layout programs, such as Adobe InDesign, Serif PagePlus and QuarkXPress.

    <h3>Interface design</h3>
        
    <p>
        Since the advent of personal computers, many graphic designers have become involved in interface design, in an environment commonly referred to as a Graphical user interface (GUI). This has included web design and software design when end user-interactivity is a design consideration of the layout or interface. Combining visual communication skills with an understanding of user interaction and online branding, graphic designers often work with software developers and web developers to create the look and feel of a web site or software application. An important aspect of interface design is icon design.
    </p>

    <h3>User experience design</h3>
    <p>
        User experience design (UX) is the study, analysis, and development of creating products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users. This involves the creation of the entire process of acquiring and integrating the product, including aspects of branding, design, usability, and function. UX design involves creating the interface and interactions for a website or application, and is considered both an act and an art. This profession requires a combination of skills, including visual design, social psychology, development, project management, and most importantly, empathy towards the end-users.[41]
    </p>

    <h3>Experiential graphic design</h3>
    <p>
        Experiential graphic design is the application of communication skills to the built environment.[42] This area of graphic design requires practitioners to understand physical installations that have to be manufactured and withstand the same environmental conditions as buildings. As such, it is a cross-disciplinary collaborative process involving designers, fabricators, city planners, architects, manufacturers and construction teams.
    </p>

    <h2 id="occupations">Occupations</h2>

    <p>
        Graphic design career paths cover all parts of the creative spectrum and often overlap. Workers perform specialized tasks, such as design services, publishing, advertising and public relations. As of 2023, median pay was $50,710 per year.[44] The main job titles within the industry are often country specific. They can include graphic designer, art director, creative director, animator and entry level production artist. Depending on the industry served, the responsibilities may have different titles such as "DTP associate" or "Graphic Artist". The responsibilities may involve specialized skills such as illustration, photography, animation, visual effects or interactive design.
    </p>

    <h3>Crowdsourcing in graphic design</h3>
    <p>
        Jeff Howe of Wired Magazine first used the term "crowdsourcing" in his 2006 article, "The Rise of Crowdsourcing."[46][47] It spans such creative domains as graphic design, architecture, apparel design, writing, illustration, and others. Tasks may be assigned to individuals or a group and may be categorized as convergent or divergent. An example of a divergent task is generating alternative designs for a poster. An example of a convergent task is selecting one poster design. Companies, startups, small businesses and entrepreneurs have all benefitted from design crowdsourcing since it helps them source great graphic designs at a fraction of the budget they used to spend before. Getting a logo design through crowdsourcing being one of the most common. Major companies that operate in the design crowdsourcing space are generally referred to as design contest sites.[citation needed]]
